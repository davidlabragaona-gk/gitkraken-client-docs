Coming from the icy depths of the Git ocean are GitKraken Client experimental features! These are ideas we are trying out that are still being worked on, but we want to share with the world sooner. 

---

## Experimental Features

Navigate to <i class="fas fa-cog"></i><kbd><strong>Preferences</strong> <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i> <strong>Experimental</strong></i></kbd> to access the experimental features menu.

Experimental Features are still under development - treat these as an early sneak peek at some of the new functionality we're working on at GitKraken. Experimental features may not work as intended and could be changed or removed in the future. These settings are entirely optional and can be turned off at any time.

If you do experience issues, or have any other feedback, please reach out to us [Contact Support](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/contact-support/?issue_category__customer_facing_field_=Experimental+feedback&subject=GitKraken+Client+Experimental+feedback).

### Git Executable

When this setting is enabled, GitKraken Client will utilize the Git executable instead of the NodeGit library for certain Git actions including fetching and committing. This may provide increased performance and compatibility with certain projects and development environments. This is a partial implementation and will only affect some aspects of Git within GitKraken Client - the amount of Git commands using the Git executable will increase with each release.

**Use Git Executable:** <i class="fa-regular fa-square-check"></i> turn on this experimental feature! Check the box to immediately apply the setting.

**Git Executable:** We automatically include Git with GitKraken Client. You can select other from other versions that are installed on your system. 

##### Features using the Git Executable

Find below a list of features using the Git binary if the Git Executable experimental setting is enabled. Anything not listed is still using LibGit2/NodeGit paths.

**Added in 9.4.0:**
- refresh commits (some of the commit info displayed in the graph)
- verify commit gpg signature
- commit
- fetch
- branch ahead/behind count (e.g. from pull request panel)
- merge base calculation (e.g. from right clicking a local branch in the left panel)
- branch rename
- branch delete (local branch only)

**Added in 9.5.0:**
- remote branch delete
- tag delete (local and remote)

**Added in 9.6.0:**
- support for SSH commit signing (configured from your gitconfig)
    - actions that do not currently use the Git Executable (like rebasing) will still use GPG for signing
- support for SSH strict host key checking

**Added in 9.6.1:**
- push
- support for streaming Git hooks output

**Added in 9.7.0:**
- Signing tags with SSH

**Added in 9.9.0:**
- Added revert commit support.
- Added pageant ssh agent support.

**Added in 9.10.0:**
- Added Pull (fast-forward if possible) and Pull (fast-forward only) support.
- Added cherry-pick support

### AI Commit Message Generation

With this setting enabled, GitKraken Client will have the ability to generate commit messages from any staged changes. You can access this feature from the Command Palette (⌘P/Ctrl P, or the magic wand icon ✨ in the toolbar), or you can click the sparkle icon () in the commit panel when you have staged changes.

<div class='callout callout--danger'>
    <p> This feature requires sending a diff of your code changes to OpenAI. Ensure your code does not contain sensitive information before generating a commit message.</p>
</div>

**Generate Commit Messages with AI:** <i class="fa-regular fa-square-check"></i> turn on this experimental feature! Check the box to immediately enable the setting.

**OpenAI API Key:** Your key generated by OpenAI. GitKraken Client uses `gpt-3.5-turbo` model for generating commit messages.

**Prompt:** This is what is sent to OpenAI. We have it pre-filled to hopefully get Open AI on the right track. However, you can enter whatever you want here and it will be sent when you click ✨.

#### How to use in GKC

Once you have AI commit message generation enabled you will see ✨ sparkles ✨ in the commit message field. Stage your changes and click this button to get the AI magic started!

Once the commit message has been generated, you can still fully edit the message before committing. You can also click the ✨ to have OpenAI try again.

<div class='callout callout--danger'>
    <p>Be aware that using OpenAI/chatGPT has a cost. At the time of this writing, the maximum cost per request is about $0.02. OpenAI offers free trial accounts with $5.00 of credit to get started.</p>

### Cloud Patches

A Cloud Patch is a Git patch GitKraken securely stores for you so you can easily share changes with your team. The code is transferred directly from your machine into secure storage - this is managed by GitKraken. Currently, anybody with access to the Cloud Patch link can view the code and apply the patch to their repository.

To create a Cloud Patch, click the share icon <i class="fa-solid fa-share"></i> in the WIP commit panel and stage the changes you want to include in the Cloud Patch. You can also create a Cloud Patch from a commit by right-clicking on a commit in the Commit Graph and selecting `Share commit as Cloud Patch`. Once created, you can select `Copy Cloud Patch link` from the toast or by right-clicking a Cloud Patch in the left panel where all your Cloud Patches will be listed.

This link can be shared with users to open the Cloud Patch in GitKraken. When a Cloud Patch link is opened, the user will be prompted to open the client, clone or open the repository if not known to GitKraken Client, and then select the base branch to apply the patch to. From here, they can simply select `apply patch to <branch>`.

When `Use Cloud Patches` is enabled, GitKraken will be able to create a Cloud Patch for you to share with other developers. To disable the ability to create a Cloud Patch, uncheck `Preferences > Experimental > Use Cloud Patches`.

### New Commit Graph

We have updated to an improved commit graph to offer more customization. The new commit graph is on by default but can be temporarily disabled from `Preferences > Experimental > Enable new commit graph`.

Some additional features currently offered by the new commit graph include:

- A "Compact Graph Column" option from Commit Graph settings gear.
- Drag and drop to reorder columns.
- Added inline commit descriptions.

To access the Compact Graph Column or add/remove columns, select the gear icon at the top right of the commit graph.
