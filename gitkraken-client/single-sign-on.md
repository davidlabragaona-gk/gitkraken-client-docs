GitKraken offers a Single Sign On (SSO) option as an easy way to sign in to your account. This is only for use with the cloud versions of GitKraken, it is not available for the serverless options.

Once your organization has set up SSO with an Identity Provider (IdP), the Owner or an Admin on your GitKraken organization can link your organization to that identity provider. Then, any users associated with your IdP can login to GitKraken apps and services. üéâ

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You must have an active GitKraken Teams or Enterprise License to enable SSO</p>

## What is Single Sign On (SSO)?

The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on' target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a> definition of SSO:

*‚ÄúSingle sign-on is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems. True single sign-on allows the user to log in once and access services without re-entering authentication factors.‚Äù*

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/sso-example-diagram.png" class="img-bordered img-responsive center">

The above diagram depicts what a typical SSO setup entails. Here is some relevant terminology:

**Directory Server:**  A Directory Server is an application that stores information about the ‚Äúobjects‚Äù that belong to an organization. An object is typically something like: printers, computers, shared folders, users, or groups. Some objects can contain other objects which then allows them to reflect hierarchical structures.  

Examples of Directory Server applications are:
* <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/ad-ds-getting-started' target='_blank'>Microsoft Active Directory</a> 
* <a href='https://www.oracle.com/security/identity-management/governance/' target='_blank'>Oracle Identity Governance (OIG) Suite</a> 
* <a href='https://jumpcloud.com/' target='_blank'>Jump Cloud</a> 

**Identity Provider:**  An identity provider (abbreviated IdP or IDP) is a system entity that creates, maintains, and manages identity information as well as provides authentication services to relying applications within a distributed network. An IdP provider stores 3 main components: Users, Groups, and Applications.

Examples of Identity Provider applications are:
* <a href='https://azure.microsoft.com/' target='_blank'>Azure Active Directory</a> 
* <a href='https://www.okta.com/' target='_blank'>Okta</a>
* <a href='https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform' target='_blank'>Google Identity Platform</a>

The Identity Providers provide services that allow third party applications to authenticate their users. The authentication mechanism they provide is called ‚ÄúOauth‚Äù, which allows third party applications to authenticate users without accessing/storing their password. 

**Third party applications:** These are the applications that use IdP services to authenticate users. The end user is redirected to the IdP to instead login there. Then the Idp directs back to the 3rd party app to complete the login, confirming that the user is who they claim to be.

Examples of  third party apps:
* <a href='https://www.gitkraken.com/' target='_blank'>GitKraken</a> 
* <a href='https://slack.com/' target='_blank'>Slack</a> 
* <a href='https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira' target='_blank'>Jira</a>

## SSO in GitKraken

GitKraken is a 3rd party application in this scenario. You (or an Owner/Admin) setup which IdP(s) you want to use and we will use them to log them in. If your organization has already set up SSO with an IdP and in GitKraken, simply [sign in](/gitkraken-client/single-sign-on/#logging-in-using-sso) and you are all set! 

If you need to set up SSO for your GitKraken Organization see [Setting up SSO on a GitKraken Organization](/gitkraken-client/single-sign-on/#setting-up-sso-on-a-gitkraken-organization)
### Supported Identity Providers

GitKraken may initiate an Oauth authentication flow with the following supported Identity Providers (IdPs):

* <a href='https://azure.microsoft.com/' target='_blank'>Azure Active Directory</a> 
* <a href='https://www.okta.com/' target='_blank'>Okta</a>
* <a href='https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform' target='_blank'>Google Identity Platform (G Suite)</a>
* <a href='https://www.pingidentity.com/' target='_blank'>Ping Identity</a>

<div class='callout callout--warning'>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Your IdP(s) will first need to be configured before setting up the connection in GitKraken.</p>
</div>

While we do not assist in setting up the identity provider, the [example IdP setup section](/gitkraken-client/single-sign-on/#example-identity-provider-idp-setup-instructions) gives step-by-step instructions for what this typically looks like.

### License Requirements

Single Sign On is available as part of the <a href='https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client/pricing' target='_blank'>teams and enterprise plans</a>. 

### Setting up SSO on a GitKraken Organization

First, some quick notes:

* SSO is set up at the Organization level. Each organization can have 0,1, or many identity providers connected simultaneously.
* SSO can only be set up by the Owner or by an Admin of the organization. 

How to set up SSO:

1. <a href='https://app.gitkraken.com/' target='_blank'>Login</a> and navigate to the organization you want to enable SSO for.

2. On the left menu click on **SSO**.

<div class='callout callout--warning'>
    <p>If you do not see the SSO option, confirm that: 1. You are logged in as the Owner or an Admin for this organization 2. Your organization has either a Teams or Enterprise subscription</p>
</div>

3. Click the `Enable SSO` checkbox and you will be presented with some additional fields:

**Organization Domain Name:** The domain that is used for everyone who wants to use SSO to login. Each user must have a matching domain in their email address and each user must be defined in the IdP.

There is only one domain allowed per GitKraken organization, and it must be unique. If your domain is already in use you can <a href='https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client/contact-support' target='_blank'>contact support</a> for help.

**JIT, Enable Just In Time Provisioning:** This allows users in this domain to login with their email and be automatically provisioned a license. In order for a user to be automatically given a license:

* Just in time provisioning must be enabled (JIT option checked)‚òë.
* The user email must be part of the SSO domain on the IdP.
* There must be an available license on the GitKraken Organization.

When a user logs in for the first time using SSO, and all three of the above conditions are met, they will be automatically given a GitKraken license.

4. Click on <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Save changes</button> to store the SSO configuration. Once this is completed you will see the <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Configure SSO Connection</button> button appear.

5. Click the <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Configure SSO Connection</button> button to set up the connection between your GitKraken Organization and the Identity Provider. You will now be able to configure the connection using [Metadata](/gitkraken-client/single-sign-on/#add-sso-connection-using-metadata).

### Add SSO Connection using Metadata

Click on <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Add Using Metadata</button> and you will see the following fields:

+ **Identity Provider:** choose a [supported provider](/gitkraken-client/single-sign-on/#supported-identity-providers) from the drop-down.
+ **IdP Metadata URL /IdP Metadata:** depending on the  IdP we can use one or both of these options for setting up the SSO connection. 
+ **Don't enable this connection immediately** ‚úÖ by default new connections are automatically enabled. This checkbox will create the connection but users will not be able to login using SSO with this IdP until it is enabled.

**Example 1:** setting up Okta

Okta is configured using a metadata file.
1. Access your Okta instance.
