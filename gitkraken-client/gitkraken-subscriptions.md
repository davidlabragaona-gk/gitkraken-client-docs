Subscriptions are tied directly to an [organization](/gitkraken-client/gitkraken-organization/), even if the subscription is for one user. The subscription is identical for everyone in the organization and one license is required for every member (unless their [role](/gitkraken-client/gitkraken-organization/##roles) does not use a license).

## How to Purchase
To purchase a subscription for the first time follow these steps:
1. Visit [app.gitkraken.com](https://app.gitkraken.com/).
2. Login with your [GitKraken account](/gitkraken-client/gitkraken-account/) or create an account.
3. If there is an existing organization in the left panel to purchase on, select that and select “Subscription” (remember you need to have a [role](/gitkraken-client/gitkraken-organization/#roles) with permission to purchase). If no organizations are listed or you intend to purchase on another, select “Create organization.”
4. Select the products that are going to be used by the organization (GitKraken Client, GitLens, or Bundle them both together). Remember GitKraken Jira products such as Git Integration for Jira do not work with your GitKraken account and do not support bundling.
5. Select the tier that is best for your organization (Pro, Teams, or Enterprise). There are links at the bottom of each while can further elaborate on the differences.
6. You will then be taken to the billing form where you can select the quantity of licenses (one for each member of the organization that will be using the product).
7. Fill out the rest of the form with all the relevant billing information and name your organization.
8. Select the "<span style='color: green;'>Complete Purchase</span>" button to complete your transaction.
9. If you added more licenses than there are members in the organization to claim, you will be taken to the "Add Users" screen.

## Cancel

You can cancel your subscription at any time. To do so, login to [app.gitkraken.com](https://app.gitkraken.com/), select the organization, select "Subscription" on the left side, and select "<span style='color: yellow;'>Cancel Subscription</span>." Follow the flow to complete cancelation. Once canceled, you will keep your subscription for the remainder of its billing period. Once the period is up, everyone in the organization will lose access to the subscription.

When your subscription is set to cancel but you can still use it, your organization will be labeled as "<span style='color: red;'>canceled</span>." When your subscription is completely canceled and the billing period has passed, it will be lableld as "<span style='color: red;'>expired</span>."

<div class='callout callout--basic'>
   	<p>Only the owner, admins, and billing contacts have permission to cancel.</p>
</div>

## Reactivation

You can always reactivate a canceled subscription. You can reactivate by logging into [app.gitkraken.com](https://app.gitkraken.com/), select the organization, select "Subscription" on the left side, and select "<span style='color: green;'>reactivate</span>." Please note the two cases.

If your subscription is set to cancel but still active, denoted as <span style='color: red;'>canceled</span>:
+ Reactivation will not charge you until your next renewal or if you decide to upgrade from the plan you already have.

If your subscription is completely canceled, denoted as <span style='color: red;'>expired</span>:
+ Selecting reactivation will require you to purchase the exact same plan you had when it was canceled.
+ If you don’t want the same exact plan you have two options:
    + [Create a new organization](/gitkraken-client/gitkraken-organization/#create).
    + Contact our [Customer Success](https://www.gitkraken.com/sales-inquiries) team for help selecting the plan you want on your existing expired organization.

## Trials
Both GitKraken Client and GitLens offer 7-day trials of Pro. You can initiate these trials by logging into the corresponding app with a GitKraken account for the first time. Each trial is separate, so starting a 7-day trial with your GitKraken account in one app does not start it for the other.

***

### Organization Trials
Organization trials are available for groups of users that would like to try GitKraken Client across members of their team, company, or organization. After an organization trial is started, 21 days are added to the remainder of the owner’s 7-day GitKraken Client trial (even if there is no time left). The duration of the organization trial is shared by everyone in the organization.

To start an organization trial:

1. Visit [app.gitkraken.com](https://app.gitkraken.com/)
2. Login with your GitKraken account
3. Select “New trial organization” (if you already have an organization and have not started a trial organization, select that and continue with step 5)
4. Name the organization when prompted
5. [Add users](/gitkraken-client/gitkraken-organization/#add-users)
6. Once users are added, your extended organization trial has begun

<div class='callout callout--basic'>
   	<p>It is not possible for a user to be a member of more than one organization trial at a time. Once the organization trial has lapsed, an owner cannot start another organization trial.</p>
